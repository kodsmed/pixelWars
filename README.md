## Squares vs Circles - A Tower shooter

### Functional requirements

- [ ] When the mouse button is pressed down, and the mouse pointer is positioned over the blackboard, the tower should shoot in the direction of the mousepointer.
- [ ] When the mouse button is released, or the mouse pointer leaves the component, the text shooting should stop.
- [ ] Squares should "attack" the tower.

- [ ] Attacks should come in waves ?

- [ ] Tower upgrades?

### Non-functional requirements

- [ ] You should create a reusable web component with all files required for the Bart board to work in the folder `src/components/pixel-wars/`.
- [ ] The component should be well documented in the provided README.md
